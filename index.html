        <h1>Crocheting</h1>
          <p>I started <em>Crocheting</em> about a year ago, on a whim it really appealed to me how a bunch of knots and loops can become this cute little peice of art work! So far, in my year of learning. I've made a dozen dish cloths, one blanket started, and two toques. I guess you can say I've mastered making squares and rectangles! My passion for learning hasn't stopped there. I would like to learn more.</p>
          <p>Crocheting for me has taught me how to be patient and also my eye and cordination has gotten better. It also calms me when I feel stressed or anxious. I'm a quick learner so learning a pattern is easy, I enjoy it very much.</p>
